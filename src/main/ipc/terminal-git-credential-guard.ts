/**
 * Disable git's interactive credential prompt for a terminal's environment so a
 * git operation that needs GitHub auth cannot make the OS credential helper
 * (Git Credential Manager on Windows) pop its "Connect to GitHub" OAuth window
 * — which, in a network-restricted intranet, can never complete and gets
 * re-triggered in a loop by git's credential retry (issue #7652).
 *
 * The credential *helper* is kept, so cached-token auth still works; only the
 * interactive fallback prompt is suppressed. Agent terminals are always guarded
 * on every platform (an agent can't answer a prompt, so failing fast beats
 * hanging). User terminals are only guarded on Windows terminal hosts — the
 * popup is a Windows credential-manager behavior, and on other platforms the
 * guard would only take working tty prompts away from an interactive user —
 * and the user can opt out via settings.
 *
 * Mutates `env` in place to match how the PTY host assembles its environment.
